# Seinfeld Scripts
As an avid fan of the show, the purpose of this repository is to maintain an archive of Seinfeld episode scripts with accurate content. The existing script .txt files are copied from the now defunct seinology website. I intend to update them as accurately as possible. About the correct format for a script, a good example would be any script from the first season that is structured properly with character, location details & stage directions.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to raise a PR!
